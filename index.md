**PUMAS** stands for **S**emi-**A**nalytical **MU**ons -or taus- **P**ropagation in reverse order.
It performs the transport of relativistic &mu; or &tau; in both forward
and backward Monte-Carlo. The library is written in C99 with the Standard
Library as sole dependency. PUMAS is thread safe by design. The library is also
shipped with an executable, `pumas-tabulate`, allowing to generate muons or taus
energy loss tables in the [PDG](http://pdg.lbl.gov/2016/AtomicNuclearProperties/index.html) format.
