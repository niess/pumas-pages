PUMAS v0.12 has been [released][v012]. It adds several improvements for
controlling and monitoring the transport. Extra verbosity has been added to
error reports as well. Note that some changes are not backward compatible with
v0.11. Does are highlighted in the [documentation][docs].

The main change is that the `pumas_transport` function is now more interactive.
It provides an event flag at exit indicating its stop condition. In addition
the start and end media of the transport are also returned. Stop conditions
for the transport can be configured by modifying the new `event` field of the
simulation context.
