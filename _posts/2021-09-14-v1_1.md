PUMAS v1.1 has been [released][v1p1]. It includes a major update of the physics,
increased numerical accuracy and quality of life improvements.  These updates
have been carefully checked e.g. by comparison to the [PROPOSAL][PROPOSAL] Monte
Carlo. Yet, in case that you spot problems please consider reporting this
[issue][issue] on [GitHub][GitHub].

**Warning** : due to a typo in the simulation of hard elastic collisions, v1.1
has been patched since it initial release ([b16e7fe][version-initial]). Please
check your git hash in order to ensure that you are using the latest patch, i.e.
[b52648f][version-patched] . The typo resulted in too large scattering, the
higher the energy of the muon. Note that it only impacts muons with kinetic
energy higher than 100 GeV.

For people using PUMAS v1.0 or below we recommend migrating to PUMAS v1.1.  The
latter brings major improvements on the numerical accuracy of PUMAS, from ~1% to
better than 0.1%.  In addition, up to date physics models are used, in
particular for radiative processes.  Please check the [release notes][v1p1] in
order to upgrade. Note that [examples][examples] of using PUMAS with
[Geant4][Geant4] or [TURTLE][TURTLE] have been added as well.

For new users the [online docs][docs] might be helpful. It contains
[tutorials][tutorials] as well as a description of the library [API][api]. The
[examples][examples] shipped with the PUMAS source might be a good starting point
as well.

_Note that work on the [LuaJIT][LuaJIT] wrapper
([pumas-luajit](https://github.com/niess/pumas-luajit)) has been discontinued.
The main motivation for using LuaJIT was to get C like performances with a
higher level scripting language. Yet, as increasing features have been added to
the LuaJIT wrapper, I did not manage to keep up with performances. Worse, very
unpredictable runtimes were observed related to the JIT compiler. Thus, this
project is currently migrating to [Python][Python] using [cffi][cffi] bindings.
Under some circumstances, native C performances can be preserved with Python by
using a [numpy][numpy] like vectorization strategy._
