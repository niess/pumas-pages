PUMAS v1.1 has been [released][v1p1]. It includes a major update of the physics,
increased numerical accuracy and quality of life improvements.  These updates
have been carefully checked e.g. by comparison to the [PROPOSAL][PROPOSAL] Monte
Carlo. Yet, in case that you spot problems please consider reporting this
[issue][issue] on [GitHub][GitHub].

For people using PUMAS v1.0 or below we recommend migrating to PUMAS v1.1.  The
latter brings major improvements on the numerical accuracy of PUMAS, from ~1% to
better than 0.1%.  In addition, up to date physics models are used, in
particular for radiative processes.  Please check the [release notes][v1p1] in
order to upgrade. Note that [examples][examples] of using PUMAS with
[Geant4][Geant4] or [TURTLE][TURTLE] have been added as well.

For new users the [online docs][docs] might be helpful. It contains
[tutorials][tutorials] as well as a description of the library [API][api]. The
[examples][examples] shipped with the PUMAS source might be a good starting point
as well.

_Note that work on the [LuaJIT][LuaJIT] wrapper
([pumas-luajit](https://github.com/niess/pumas-luajit)) has been discontinued.
The main motivation for using LuaJIT was to get C like performances with a
higher level scripting language. Yet, as increasing features have been added to
the LuaJIT wrapper, I did not manage to keep up with performances. Worse, very
unpredictable runtimes were observed related to the JIT compiler. Thus, this
project is currently migrating to [Python][Python] using [cffi][cffi] bindings.
Under some circumstances, native C performances can be preserved with Python by
using a [numpy][numpy] like vectorization strategy._
