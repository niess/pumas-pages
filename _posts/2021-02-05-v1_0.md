Finally after five years of sparse development, version 1.0 of PUMAS has been
[released][v100]. This version includes most of the initially foreseen
features. There have been quite some changes w.r.t. the last version (v0.14).
Please check the releases note if you want to upgrade. For new users the
[examples](https://github.com/niess/pumas/tree/master/examples) and the
[wiki](https://github.com/niess/pumas/wiki) could be a good starting point. In
case you have any problems with this update, you can also submit an
[issue][issue].

For the future we don't foresee breaking changes in the PUMAS transport engine
itself. Current work is focusing on a higher level wrapper that would simplify
the development of PUMAS based simulations. A alpha version is available on
GitHub as [pumas-luajit](https://github.com/niess/pumas-luajit), yet poorly
documented for now. Depending on your needs this might be more usefull to you
than directly using the C engine. In particular, the wrapper extends PUMAS with
some geometries, e.g. an Earth one using the
[TURTLE](https://niess.github.io/turtle-pages/) library.
