PUMAS v1.2 has been [released][v1p2]. It improves the sampling efficiency of
backward collisions for radiative processes. However, for very long distances
and small energy cutoffs, the current sampling method for backward collisions is
numerically problematic. Therefore, for now PUMAS forbids using energy cutoffs
values lower than 1% in backward mixed or straggled modes. The latter value has
been checked to be numerically robust at least up to 10 km of standard rock (see
Note that in forward mode, arbitrary cutoffs values can still be used.

In addition, PUMAS v1.2 introduces a thiner versioning with patch number. This
should allow for cleaner bug patches in the future. In particular, patch 1
(v1.2.1) corrects a memory alignment issue with some compilers / versions
combinations when using aggressive optimisation settings (e.g. `-O3` with
`gcc`).
