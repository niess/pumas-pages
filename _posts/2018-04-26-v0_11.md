PUMAS v0.11 has been [released][v011]. It corrects **one bug** introduced
in 0.10 preventing *distance limits* to be applied in backward mode. It also
**simplifies** the implementation of media *local properties* by initialising
them to null at every change of medium.

With v0.11 [examples][examples] have been added as well as a [wiki][wiki]
documentation. Note that the [wiki][wiki] has *public* write access. Feel free
to contribute! Also, if there are examples you'd like to share, they can be
submitted as [pull requests][PR].
