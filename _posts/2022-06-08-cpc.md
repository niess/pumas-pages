The very details of the PUMAS library are now published in [Computer Physics
Communications][CPC] as [10.1016/j.cpc.2022.108438][doi] ([2206.01457][arxiv]).

The paper contains a detailed desription of PUMAS physics, as of v1.2, and of
its implementation. Validation results are also provided. In particular, it is
shown that PUMAS default settings should be accurate for most muography
applications.
