The Backward Monte-Carlo (BMC) paper has been accepted for publication in
[Computer Physics Communications][CPC]. It is now published online with the
following DOI: [10.1016/j.cpc.2018.04.001][doi], or from [arXiv][arxiv].

The paper contains detailed explanations and *proofs* of the BMC
procedure used in PUMAS. The implementation is also discussed in details,
in section 3. Some validation figures can be found in section 4.
