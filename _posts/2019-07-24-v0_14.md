PUMAS v0.14 has been [released][v014]. It allows for better optimisations of the
geometry navigation by providing extra info to the `pumas_medium_cb`. The
stepping algorithms was slightly tuned accordingly. In addition, a bug
has been corrected for non uniform magnetic fields as well.

Note that the signature of the `pumas_medium_cb` has changed. Please check the
[docs][docs]. Details on the updated stepping mechanism can be found on the
[release][v014] page. In case you have any problems with this update, you can
submit an [issue][issue].
